# I Chews You / Food App

Search, explore and comment on your favourite food recipes. Users can sign-up and add comments / ratings to different recipes. Configured as a full-stack database backed application using Javascript (express), SQL (Postgres DB), HTML, CSS. 

## About

The task at hand was to build a functional full-stack database backed application in a small team. This focused on testing our both our technical and collaborative working abilities.

Team members included: 
- gjstephen (https://github.com/gjstephen) 
- clane62 (https://github.com/clane62)

## Planning

1. Determining a suitable API
- Initial work was done to experiment with different APIs
- The data that was available to be fetched determined how we proceeded with layout and functionality in step 2.

2. Layout / functionality
- Initial design of the layout and flow was completed in Figma. This allowed us to visualise where each element would sit on the page and what database / API interaction would be needed.

3. Task flow
- In addition to constant discussion over Zoom we utilised the Figma planning and a Trello board to organise our gameplan to MVP. A Snippet of our trello board provided below

## Challenges
- We found our greatest obstacle to be GitHub collaboration flow and spent countless hours debugging conflicts
- We note that more detailed pre-work into API usage would be essential on future projects as we came into issues with rate limiting etc.

## Technology
- Javascript (Express + vanilla client side code)
- SQL databases
- API requests
- HTML
- CSS

## Improvements
- Various CSS visual improvements can be made i.e. mobile friendly use
- Smoother logic flow when adding / editing comments
